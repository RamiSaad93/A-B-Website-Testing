# Vanguard A/B Testing

## Introduction

- An A/B test for the website was initiated by the team at the US-based investment management company Vanguard, from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017.
    - Control Group: Clients interacted with Vanguardâ€™s traditional online process.
    - Test Group: Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.
- Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.
- The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

## Datasets
- There are three datasets that will be used in this project:
    - Client Profiles (df_final_demo): Demographics like age, gender, and account details of our clients.
    - Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data): A detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts: pt_1 and pt_2.
    - Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients): A list revealing which clients were part of the grand experiment.
